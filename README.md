The B repository contains the initial code which uses user input to track chain lifespan. This takes into account inputs for Distance, Elevation, Power (watts) and Bike Cleaning. Further details such as Weight and Watts/kg could be added if added from Strava data in repository A.

The A repository contains some of the B repository plus the Strava API, along with the dataset fields needed (Elevation, Distance etc.).
